2025-08-29 18:39:24,351 - chatbot_logger - INFO - Bot: Hi Himank, it's great to meet you! I'm here to support you in any way I can. As a mental wellbeing chatbot, I'm trained to provide a safe and non-judgmental space for you to talk about your thoughts, feelings, and experiences.

Since you're feeling sad right now, I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel that way. It's normal to have ups and downs, and I'm here to help you work through those feelings.

Would you like to talk about what's been going on that's making you feel sad? Sometimes sharing what's on your mind can help you feel a bit better. If you're not ready to talk about it, we can also explore some calming exercises or coping strategies together.

Remember, everything we discuss is confidential and respectful. What's most important is that you feel comfortable and supported. How does that sound?
